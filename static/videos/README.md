3. Crop or scale the video to exactly 1920x1080
4. Remove audio track to reduce file size
5. Use H.264 codec with MP4 container for best browser compatibility

### Fallback Behavior

If the video file is not present or fails to load, the hero section will automatically fall back to an animated gradient background. This ensures the page remains functional even without the video.

### Example Content Ideas

- Cinematic gaming footage (esports highlights)
- Abstract motion graphics with red/black theme
- Particle effects and energy animations
- Tournament arena atmosphere
- Dynamic logo animations

### Testing

After adding your video, test the hero section to ensure:
- Video loads and plays automatically
- Video loops seamlessly
- Video is muted
- Fallback works if video is removed
- Performance is acceptable on various devices
